            <h2>SOMNATH JYOTIRLING</h2>
            <p>Somnath Temple, located in Prabhas Patan, Gujarat, is one of the twelve Jyotirlingas, the most sacred
                shrines dedicated to Lord Shiva. It is the first Jyotirlinga and holds immense spiritual and historical
                significance for Hindus. The temple has been rebuilt multiple times throughout history, symbolizing
                resilience and faith. <br>About Place: The intricately carved honey-coloured Somnath temple on the
                western edge of the state is believed to be the place where the first of the twelve holy jyotirlingas
                emerged in India – a spot where Shiva appeared as a fiery column of light. The temples lies at the
                meeting of Kapila, Hiran and Sarasvati rivers and the waves of the Arabian Sea ebb and flow touching the
                shore on which it is constructed. The ancient temple’s timeline can be traced from 649 BC but is
                believed to be older than that. The present form was reconstructed in 1951. Colourful dioramas of the
                Shiva story line the north side of the temple garden, though it’s hard to see them through the hazy
                glass. A one-hour sound-and-light show in Amitabh Bachchan’s baritone highlights the temple nightly at
                7.45pm. <br>Brief History: It is said that Somraj (the moon god) first built a temple in Somnath, made
                of gold; this was later rebuilt by Ravana in silver, by Krishna in wood, and by Bhimdev in stone. The
                current serene, symmetrical structure was built to traditional designs on the original coastal site:
                it’s painted a creamy colour and boasts fine sculpture. At its heart is a large, black Shiva lingam—one
                of the 12 most sacred Shiva shrines, known as the jyotirlingas.</p>

            <h2>MALIKARJUNA JYOTIRLING</h2>
            <p>Lord Shiva and his consort Goddess Parvati could not make up their minds as to which of their sons,
                Ganesha or Kartikeya should get married first. To determine who would be first, they set a contest for
                the two: whoever would go around the world first would be the winner.

                Lord Kartikeya immediately set off on his mount, the peacock. Lord Ganesha, on the other hand, went
                around his parents claiming that they were the world to him. It is said that going around one’s parents
                is equivalent to going around the world. So, he outwitted his brother and won the race. The pleased
                parents married their son off to Siddhi (spiritual powers) and Riddhi (prosperity). In some legends,
                Buddhi (intellect) is also believed to be his wife.

                When Lord Kartikeya heard about this on his return, he was upset and decided that he would remain
                unmarried. (However, in some Tamil legends he is said to have two wives.) He left for Mount Krounch and
                started living there. His parents visited him there and hence there is a shrine for both there – a linga
                for Shiva and a Shakti Peetha for Parvati.</p>

            <h2>MAHAKALESHWAR JYOTIRLING</h2>
            <p>Mahakaleshwar Jyotirlinga (IAST: mahākāleśvara) is a Hindu temple dedicated to Shiva and is one of the
                twelve Jyotirlingas, shrines which are said to be the most sacred abodes of Shiva. It is located in the
                ancient city of Ujjain in the state of Madhya Pradesh, India. The temple is situated on the side of the
                holy river Shipra. The presiding deity, Shiva in the lingam form is believed to be Swayambhu, deriving
                currents of power (Shakti) from within itself as against the other images and lingams that are ritually
                established and invested with mantra-shakti. <br><br>
                The presiding deity of time, Shiva, in all his splendor, reigns eternally in the city of Ujjain. The
                temple of Mahakaleshwar, its shikhar soaring into the sky, an imposing façade against the skyline,
                evokes primordial awe and reverence with its majesty. The Mahakal dominates the life of the city and its
                people, even in the midst of the busy routine of modern preoccupations, and provides an unbreakable link
                with ancient Hindu traditions. <br><br>

                Madhya Pradesh has two Jyotirlingas, the second one, Omkareshwar Jyotirlinga, is situated about 140 km
                south of Mahakaleshwar Jyotirlinga.</p>

            <h2>BAIDYANATH JYOTIRLING</h2>
            <p>Baidyanath Dham, is a Hindu temple dedicated to Shiva. It is located in Deoghar, in the Santhal Parganas
                division of the Indian state of Jharkhand.[1] The temple complex comprises the central shrine of Baba
                Baidyanath along with 21 additional temples. It is significant to the Hindu sects of Shaivism as this
                temple is referred to as one of the twelve Jyotirlingas. <br><br>
                According to the legends, Ravana was performing penance in the Himalayan region to appease Shiva. He
                offered nine of his heads as an offering to Shiva. As he was to sacrifice his tenth head, Shiva appeared
                before him and expressed satisfaction with the offering. Then, Shiva asked what boon he desired. Ravana
                asked to take the "Kamna Linga'' to the island of Lanka and expressed his desire to take Shiva from
                Kailash to Lanka. <br><br>

                Shiva agreed to Ravana's request but with a condition. He said that if the lingam was placed en route,
                it would become the permanent abode of the deity and could never be moved. <br><br>
                According to Shiv Mahapuran, once Brahma (the Hindu God of creation) and Vishnu (the Hindu God of
                preservation) had an argument in terms of supremacy of creation.[5] To test them, Shiva pierced the
                three worlds as a huge endless pillar of light, the Jyotirlinga. Vishnu and Brahma split their way
                downwards and upwards respectively to find the end of the light in either direction. Brahma lied that he
                found out the end, while Vishnu conceded his defeat. Shiva appeared as the second pillar of light and
                cursed Brahma, that he would have no place in ceremonies while Vishnu would be worshipped until the end
                of eternity. The jyotirlinga is the supreme partless reality, out of which Shiva partly appears. The
                jyotirlinga shrines, thus are places where Shiva appeared as a fiery column of light.

            <p>
                Bhimashankar Temple is a Hindu temple dedicated to Shiva situated in its eponymous village,
                Bhimashankar, in Pune district of Maharashtra. It is a key pilgrimage centre and contains one of the 12
                Jyotirlingas.[1] The temple's Shiva lingam is one of the five Jyotirlingas of Maharashtra.[2] The mandir
                is situated on a mountain, 110 kilometers away from Pune. The temple's vicinity has rare plant and
                animal species.[1] The mandir is located in Khed taluka, in the Bhimashankar forest range. <br><br>

                The Bhima River originates from the Bhimashankar village, and the hills of the Manmad village are
                present near it, there are old rock carvings of the God Bhimashankar, Bhootings and Amba-Ambika on these
                hills. <br><br>
                According to Namdev, a saint in the medieval era, Saint Jnaneshwar went to Tryambakeshwar and then
                Bhimashankar. Namdev himself has also visited this place. <br><br>

                Bhimashankaram shrine and the Bhimarathi river have been talked about in writings as far back as the
                13th century;[4] however, the current construction of the temple seems to be fairly new. <br><br>

                The temple is built in the Nagara style, which combines traditional and modern designs. The temple hall
                was constructed during the 18th century by Nāna Phadnavis of Peshwa.[6] The village of Kharosi was
                granted to the temple by King Shivaji. The daily religious observance was funded through the financial
                resources derived from the people of the area

            <h2>RAMESHWARAM JYOTIRLING</h2>
            <p>
                Ramanathaswamy Temple (Rāmanātasvāmi Kōyil) is a Hindu temple dedicated to the Hindu god Shiva located
                on Rameswaram island in the state of Tamil Nadu, India. It is one of the twelve Jyotirlinga temples. It
                is one of the 275 Paadal Petra Sthalams, the sacred sites glorified by the Nayanars (Shaivite
                poet-saints), Appar, Sundarar, and Sambandar, with their songs. According to tradition, the lingam (an
                aniconic form of Shiva) of the Ramanathaswamy Temple was established and worshipped by Rama before he
                crossed the bridge called Rama Setu to the island kingdom of Lanka, identified with Sri Lanka. It is one
                of the Char Dham pilgrimage sites. The temple was expanded during the 12th century by the Pandya
                Dynasty, and its principal shrine’s sanctum was renovated by Jeyaveera Cinkaiariyan and his successor
                Gunaveera Cinkaiariyan, monarchs of the Jaffna kingdom. The temple has the longest corridor among all
                the Hindu temples of India. It was built by King Muthuramalinga Sethupathy.[1][2] The temple is
                considered a pilgrimage site for Shaivites, Vaishnavites, and Smartas. <br><br>
                In the Shiva Purana, Rama propitiates Shiva on the shore of Rameswaram in the form of a lingam by the
                repetition of mantras, meditation, and dancing. Pleased, the deity appeared before Rama and granted his
                requested boon of victory over Ravana. Rama then requested the deity to remain on the island to sanctify
                the world and offer his grace to all people. The text states that the worship of the Rameshvara lingam
                offers worldly pleasures and salvation for its devotees.

            <h2>NAGESHWAR JYOTIRLING</h2>
            <p>
                Nageshwar Temple is a Hindu temple dedicated to the Hindu god Shiva located on Dwarka, Gujarat, India.
                It is one of the legendary temples mentioned in the Shiva Purana and one of the twelve Jyotirlingas.
                <br><br>
                According to the Shiv Mahapuraan, Brahma (the Creator) and Vishnu (the Preserver) once had a
                disagreement about which of them were supreme.[1] To test them, Shiva pierced the three worlds as an
                immeasurable pillar of light, the Jyotirlinga. Vishnu and Brahma parted company to determine the extent
                of each end of the pillar. Brahma, who had set off upward, lied that he had discovered the upper end of
                the pillar, but Vishnu, who had gone in the direction of the base of the pillar, admitted that he had
                not. Shiva then appeared as a second Jyotirlinga and cursed Brahma, telling him that he would have no
                place in the ceremonies. The Jyotirlinga is the supreme indivisible reality from which Shiva appears.
                Jyothirlinga shrines commemorate this time when Shiva appeared.[2][3] It was believed that there were
                originally sixty-four jyotirlingas. Twelve are considered to be especially auspicious and holy.[1] Each
                of the twelve sites takes the name of the presiding deity and each is considered a separate
                manifestation of Shiva.[4] At all these sites, the primary deity is a lingam representing the beginning
                less and endless Stambha pillar, symbolizing the Shiva's infinite nature.[4][5][6] The twelve
                jyothirlinga are Somnath in Gujarat, Mallikarjuna at Srisailam in Andhra Pradesh, Mahakaleswar at Ujjain
                in Madhya Pradesh, Omkareshwar in Madhya Pradesh, Kedarnath in Himalayas, Bhimashankar in Maharashtra,
                Viswanath at Varanasi in Uttar Pradesh, Triambakeshwar in Maharashtra, Vaidyanath at Deoghar in
                Jharkhand, Nageshvara in Gujarat, Rameshwar at Rameswaram in Tamil Nadu and Grishneshwar at Aurangabad
                in Maharashtra.

            <h2>KASHI VISHWANATH JYOTIRLING</h2>
            <p>
                Kashi Vishwanath Temple is a Hindu temple dedicated to Shiva. It is located in Vishwanath Gali, in
                Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh, India. The temple is a Hindu pilgrimage site and is one of the twelve
                Jyotirlinga shrines. The presiding deity is known by the names Vishwanath and Vishweshwara (IAST:
                Viśvanātha and Viśveśvara), meaning Lord of the Universe. <br><br>

                The original temple, called the Adi Vishveshwar Temple, was demolished by Mohammad of Ghor during his
                invasion of India. Subsequently, the template was rebuilt by Man Singh I and Todar Mal under the emperor
                Akbar. According to several historical accounts, the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb ordered the demolition of
                the Hindu temple in 1669.[1] Subsequently, in 1678, the Gyanvapi Mosque was built on its site,[2] but
                Hindu pilgrims continued to visit the remnants of the temple.[1] The current structure was constructed
                on an adjacent site by the Maratha ruler Ahilyabai Holkar of Indore in 1780. <br><br>

                In 2021, a major redevelopment of the temple complex was completed, and the Kashi Vishwanath Dham
                Corridor connecting the Ganga river with the temple was inaugurated by Prime Minister Modi, leading to a
                many-fold increase in visitors.[4][5] It has become one of the most visited Hindu temples in India, with
                an average 45,000 pilgrims per day in 2023.[6] The total assets of the temple, were estimated to be more
                than ₹6 crores in 2024.

            <p>
                Trimbakeshwar Shiva Temple (श्री त्र्यंबकेश्वर ज्योतिर्लिंग मंदिर) is an ancient Hindu temple in the
                town of Trimbak, in the Trimbakeshwar tehsil in the Nashik District of Maharashtra, India, 28 km from
                the city of Nashik and 40 km from Nashik road.[1][2] It is dedicated to the Hindu god Shiva and is one
                of the twelve jyotirlingas where the Hindu genealogy registers at Trimbakeshwar, Maharashtra are kept.
                The origin of the sacred Godavari River is near Trimbak.[3] Several Hindu rituals are carried out in
                Trimbakeshwar, for that pilgrims travel from all over India. <br><br>

                The Kusavarta kunda (sacred pond) in the temple premises, built by Shrimant Sardar Raosaheb Parnerkar,
                who was the Fadnavis of Indore State, is the source of the Godavari River, the second longest river in
                India. A bust of Sardar Fadnavis and his wife can be seen on the edge of the kunda. The current temple
                was built by Peshwa Balaji Baji Rao after it was destroyed by Mughal ruler Aurangzeb. <br><br>
                As per the Shiva Purana, once Brahma (the Hindu God of creation) and Vishnu (the Hindu God of
                preservation) had an argument in terms of supremacy of creation. To test them, Shiva pierced the three
                worlds as a huge endless pillar of light, the jyotirlinga. Vishnu and Brahma split their ways to
                downwards and upwards respectively to find the end of the light in either direction. Brahma lied that he
                found out the end, while Vishnu conceded his defeat. Shiva, then assumed his true form and cursed Brahma
                that he would have no place in ceremonies while Vishnu would be worshipped till the end of eternity. The
                jyotirlinga is the supreme partless reality, out of which Shiva partly appears. The Jyotirlinga shrines,
                thus are places where Shiva appeared as a fiery column of light. Originally there were believed to be 64
                jyotirlingas, while 12 of them are considered to be very auspicious and holy.

            <h2>KEDARNATH JYOTIRLING</h2>
            <p>
                Kēdāranātha Temple (Sanskrit: केदारनाथ मंदिर, IAST: Kēdāranātha Mandira, lit. 'temple of the God of the
                field') is a Hindu temple, one of the twelve jyotirlinga of Śiva. The temple is located on the Garhwal
                Himalayan range[1] near the Mandākinī river, in the state of Uttarakhand, India. Due to extreme weather
                conditions, the temple is open to the general public only between the months of April (Akṣaya Tritiya)
                and November (Kārtika Pūrṇimā, the autumn full moon). During the winters, the vigraha (deity) of the
                temple is carried down to Ukhimath to be worshiped for the next six months. Kēdāranātha is seen as a
                homogeneous form of Śiva, the 'Lord of Kēdārakhaṇḍa', the historical name of the region. <br><br>

                The temple is not directly accessible by road and has to be reached by a 17 kilometres (11 mi) uphill
                trek from Gaurikuṇḍa. According to Hindu legends, the temple was initially built by the Pāṇḍavas, and is
                one of the twelve Jyotirlingas, the holiest Hindu shrines of Śiva.[1] The Pāṇḍava were supposed to have
                pleased Śiva by doing penance in Kēdāranātha.[1][4] The temple is one of the four major sites in India's
                Chota Char Dham pilgrimage of Northern Himalayas and is the first of the Pañca Kēdāra pilgrimage sites.
                This temple is the highest among the 12 Jyotirlingas.[5] It is one of the 275 paadal petra sthalams
                expounded in the Tēvaram. This temple is sung of by Tirugnāṇasambandar, Appar, Sundarar and Sekkizhar in
                their Tēvaram texts. <br><br>

                Kēdāranātha was the worst affected area during the 2013 flash floods in North India. The temple complex,
                surrounding areas, and Kēdāranātha town suffered extensive damage, but the temple structure did not
                suffer any major damage. A large rock among the debris acted as a barrier, protecting the temple from
                the flood

            <h2>GRISHNESHWAR JYOTIRLING</h2>
            <p>
                Grushneshwar Jyotirlinga is a Hindu temple of Shiva in Verul village of Aurangabad district,
                Maharashtra, India. It is one of the 12 Jyotirlinga mandirs.[2][3][4] The mandir is a national protected
                site, one and a half kilometers away from the Ellora Caves, 30 kilometres (19 miles) north-west of the
                city Aurangabad, and 300 kilometres (190 miles) east-northeast far from Mumbai.[5] Grushneshwar is
                mentioned in the Shiva Purana, the Skanda Purana, the Ramayana and the Mahabharata. <br><br>
                The temple structure was destroyed by the Delhi Sultanate in 13th and 14th centuries. The temple went
                through several rounds of rebuilding followed by re-destruction during the Mughal-Maratha conflict.
                Maloji Bhosale (grandfather of Shivaji) first restored it in the 16th century and rebuilt it to its
                current form in the year 1729, under the sponsorship of queen Gautama Bai Holkar of Indore, after the
                fall of the Mughal Empire.[6][8][9] It is presently an important and active pilgrimage site of the
                Hindus and attracts long lines of devotees daily. Anyone can enter the temple premises and its inner
                chambers, but to enter the sanctum sanctorum (garbha-gruha) of the temple, the local Hindu tradition
                demands that men must go bare-chested.
